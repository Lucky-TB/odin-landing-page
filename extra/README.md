# odin-landing-page

This project is gonna showcase my intermediate HTML and CSS skills. I didn't read the information for these skills on The Odin Project since I already learned about it on FreeCodeCamp but since I am transitioning to TOP from FCC I am doing the projects that contain skills that I already got from FCC.
